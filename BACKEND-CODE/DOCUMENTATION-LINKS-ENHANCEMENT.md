# Documentation Links Enhancement

## Overview

Enhanced the AI grading prompts to include package-specific documentation links when suggesting updates, making recommendations more actionable and educational.

## âœ… Changes Made

### **1. Updated Documentation Instructions**
Both JavaScript/TypeScript and C/C++ prompts now include:
```
**DOCUMENTATION**: Where appropriate, include relevant documentation links (e.g., official docs, best practices guides) to help students learn more about the concepts discussed. When suggesting package updates, include links to the official documentation for those packages.
```

### **2. Added Example with Package Links**
Updated the dependency analysis example to show how package-specific links should be included:

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "express": "^4.18.2",  // Potentially outdated - recommend checking for latest stable version ([Express.js docs](https://expressjs.com/))
    "jsonwebtoken": "^8.5.1"  // May have security vulnerabilities - recommend updating ([JWT docs](https://github.com/auth0/node-jsonwebtoken))
  }
}
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Benefits

### **More Actionable Recommendations**
- **Direct Access**: Students can immediately access official package documentation

When the AI suggests updating packages, it will now include:
1. **Package Name**: Clear identification of the package
2. **Issue Description**: Why the update is recommended
3. **Documentation Link**: Direct link to official package documentation
4. **Actionable Next Steps**: What the student should do next
